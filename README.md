# cliptool

This is for my father.
He copies files to the clipboard and wants to extract filenames without path from them.
I tried to solve this with tauri+sveltekit and it worked.

(Released only as a debian package i ran successfully on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.)

I don't even know, if this runs on wayland?!
